My first self-made training project on git. I'm discovering and learning how does it work.

This folder is intented to share my first steps with integration automated test in Cypress made on a site https://demo.saleor.io/

On start i've added ignore file to don't make a trash of node.modules from cypress here and my first simple automation in "integration" folder but currently it got some issues probably due to constant changes form developers... I'll try fix it soon and try to get it up to date probably with some new features.
