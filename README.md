My first self-made training project on git. I'm discovering and learning how does it work.

This folder is intented to share my first steps with integration automated test in Cypress made on a site https://demo.saleor.io/

On start i've added ignore file to don't make a trash of node.modules from cypress here and my first simple automation in "integration" folder
